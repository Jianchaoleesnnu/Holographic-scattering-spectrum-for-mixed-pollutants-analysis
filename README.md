# Holographic-scattering-spectrum-for-mixed-pollutants-analysis
Image set composed of 2,400 holographic scattering spectrums (i.e., HSS-2400), and their concentration labels (i.e., 2400 labels) of ternary pollution system (containing Ni2+, Cu2+ and Cr3+). There is a one to one relationship between the HSS image and 3-dimensional concentration labels.
