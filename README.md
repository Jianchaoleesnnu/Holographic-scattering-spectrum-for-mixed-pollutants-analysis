# Holographic-scattering-spectrum-for-mixed-pollutants-analysis
We present a machine learning (ML) method for rapid detecting mixed pollutants through the synergistic application of holographic scattering spectrums and convolutional neural networks. The results showed that a well-trained ML model could realize quantitative analysis of the multi-component samples by extracting spectral information of matters, suggesting its value in facilitating the study of complex chemical systems. This repository is a data support for our paper under submission. To advance the research, we will fully demonstrate our progresses, and share our data sets including image sets and their labels.

  The dataset in the Master includes: image set (i.e.,"HSS-4800.rar") composed of 4,800 holographic scattering spectrums, and their concentration labels (i.e., "4800 labels.xlsx") of the ternary system (containing Hg2+, Pb2+ and Tet). Besides, in the branch of "HSS-2400", thre is a data set of ternary pollution system (Ni2+, Cu2+ and Cr3+), which is composed of 2,400 holographic scattering spectrums (i.e."HSS-2400.rar") and their concentration labels (i.e., "2400 labels.xlsx"). There is a one to one relationship between the HSS image and 3-dimensionalconcentration labels.
